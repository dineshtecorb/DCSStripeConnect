## Requirements

The Stripe Terminal iOS SDK is compatible with apps supporting iOS 11 and above.

pod "Stripe" 


## Installation

Stirpe support CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager

# CocoaPods

If you haven’t already, install the latest version of CocoaPods.

Add this line to your Podfile:

``pod 'Stripe'``

Run the following command:

``pod install``

From now on, don’t forget to use the *.xcworkspace file to open your project in Xcode, instead of the .xcodeproj file.

In the future, to update to the latest compatible version of the SDK, just run:

``pod update Stripe``
